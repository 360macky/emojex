    Converter of popular culture texts to emoji
</p>


## 💻 Core Development

The `get_emoji` function is a function that takes in a piece of text and an optional parameter called max_tokens. It uses the OpenAI API to generate a text completion based on a prompt that includes a list of different texts and their corresponding emojis, followed by the input text and a colon.

The `max_tokens` parameter determines the maximum number of tokens (i.e. words or word-like units) that the generated text completion can have. The function also sets some other parameters for the text completion, such as the temperature, top_p, frequency penalty, presence penalty, and stop, which control the style and content of the generated text. Finally, the function returns the text completion generated by the OpenAI API.

## 🐍 How to use
